This archive will try to document the project development faces. So it will be separated on diferent things, from [CAD](https://github.com/eml-ara/Wheel_Intertia_Pendulum/blob/Presentation/Hardware/Inverted%20pendulum%20Drawing.pdf)
, to the electronics used and developmentboards, as well as the code.
Specially there will be different branches for developing [Hardware](https://github.com/eml-ara/Wheel_Intertia_Pendulum/tree/Presentation/Hardware)
and Software, please review this sections for a more up tu date, in proces development on the proyect.
